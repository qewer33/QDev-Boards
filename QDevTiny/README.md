### Description

QDevTiny is a small board that is built around the Atmel ATTiny25/45/85 microcontroller. It has an 8 pin header, 6 of them being GPIO pins. It also includes an ISP programming header for easy use with Atmel programmers. The board has a USB Type-A male edge connector for power and USB programming. USB programming requires the Micronucleus bootloader (which provides software USB support for Atmel microcontrollers) to be flashed.
