# QDev Boards

QDev Boards is a series of development boards that are inexpensive, simple and easy to order and assemble for beginner hobbyists.

This repository currently only has one entry but I plan to add more as I design and protoype new boards.

I am still fairly new and inexperienced when it comes to electronics and PCB design so if you have any suggestions or critics, please send them my way.

## QDevTiny `rev 1`

QDevTiny is a small board that is built around the Atmel ATTiny25/45/85 microcontroller. It has an 8 pin header, 6 of them being GPIO pins. It also includes an ISP programming header for easy use with Atmel programmers. The board has a USB Type-A male edge connector for power and USB programming. USB programming requires the Micronucleus bootloader (which provides software USB support for Atmel microcontrollers) to be flashed.
