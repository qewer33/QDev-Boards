# QDev Boards

QDev Boards is a series of development boards that are inexpensive, simple and easy to order and assemble for beginner hobbyists.

This repository currently only has one entry but I plan to add more as I design and protoype new boards.

I am still fairly new and inexperienced when it comes to electronics and PCB design so if you have any suggestions or critics, please send them my way.
